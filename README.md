# ShelterOutcomeKaggle
EDA + Modeling for the Shelter Outcome Kaggle Competition 

Exploratory data analysis on the Shelter Outcome Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/scripts).
If you want to actually look at the HTML version of the exploratory data analysis you can do so directly at Kaggle scripts,
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/apapiu/shelter-animal-outcomes/visualizing-breeds-and-ages-by-outcome).

For the models I try logistic regression and random forests after doing some feature extraction. I've also been playing around with 
`xgboost` for a bit so I will upload that shortly.
